# ❤️ Heart Disease Risk Analysis | Power BI (Mini Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes heart disease risk
using patient health data. The dashboard combines **visual analytics, AI-powered insights,
and drill-down analysis** to identify key medical and lifestyle factors contributing to
heart disease.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- AI Visuals (Key Influencers, Ask AI)  
- Drill-Down & Interactive Filters  
- Data Visualization & Dashboard Design  

---

## 📊 Key KPIs
- **Total Patients:** 500  
- **Heart Disease Cases:** 234  
- **Heart Disease Rate:** 46.8%  
- **Average Age:** 55.38  

All KPIs dynamically update based on slicers such as **Gender, BMI Category,
Blood Pressure, and Age Group**.

---

## 📈 Dashboard Insights

### 🔹 Heart Disease by Age Group
- Heart disease risk increases significantly after **50 years**
- The **61–70 years** and **Above 70 years** age groups show the highest risk
- Younger age groups show comparatively lower risk

**Insight:** Age is a strong contributor to heart disease.

---

### 🔹 BMI Category Distribution
- **Obese and Overweight** patients account for the highest number of cases
- **Normal BMI** shows lower risk
- **Underweight** has minimal impact

**Insight:** Higher BMI is strongly associated with heart disease risk.

---

### 🔹 Heart Disease by Gender
- Female cases: **120**
- Male cases: **114**

**Insight:** Heart disease distribution is almost equal across genders,
indicating that medical and lifestyle factors play a bigger role.

---

### 🔹 Blood Pressure vs Cholesterol & Risk
- Patients with **Hypertension** show higher cholesterol levels
- Combined high BP and cholesterol increase heart disease probability

---

## 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis

### 🔸 Key Influencers Visual
Power BI AI automatically identified the most influential factors:
- **Diabetes** (strongest influencer)
- **Hypertension**
- **Obesity**
- **Older Age Groups**

This analysis was generated **without manual calculations**.

---

### 🔸 Ask AI – Heart Disease Insights
Users can ask natural language questions such as:
- *“What is the average age by BMI category?”*
- *“Which age group has the highest heart disease risk?”*

Power BI instantly generates visual answers.

---

## 🔍 Drill-Down Analysis
- Drill-down by **Age Group, BMI Category, and Blood Pressure**
- Confirms higher risk among **older, obese, and hypertensive patients**
